Simple Single Sign-On
==========

This is a project spun-off from custom development work for PracticalPlants.org to support a shared user database and associated log in functionality between various open source web apps.  There are currently adapters available for:

* MediaWiki
* Vanilla Forums
* Wordpress


It supports local registration/authentication and also login from a number of OpenID/OAuth providers (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc)

It's rough, it doesn't have tests, and it's completely unsupported. Use it at your own risk! If you find a bug, pull requests are welcomed!
